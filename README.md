# Number-To-Word-Converter
A Ruby script that converts numbers to a readable format

## How it works
It loops through digit by digit, starting with the large numbers and then renders the numbers in between. 
If the numbers aren't a large number, it will attempt to find the next large number. The phrase is concatinated until all the numbers have been looped through.
